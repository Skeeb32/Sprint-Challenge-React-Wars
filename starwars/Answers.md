1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

Reach JS is a library that provides help with building large scale applications effectively. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded. There are many benefits to starting out with this particular library, especially as new developers, because of the way it leans you toward learning more about JavaScript and it doesn’t force you to rely on too much of its API in order to get things done. This allows for one to gain much more in depth knowledge about the JavaScript programming language, because you get a chance to write a lot of vanilla from within the React ecosystem.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

It’s just a different way of learning out to apply what we’ve learned so far in a react format.

3. Describe state.

State is a model data in React. State is a plain JavaScript object. State holds information that influences the output of render and then manages the data within the component which is similar to a variable declared within a function. 

4. Describe props.

Props, short for properties, is a model data in React. Props is a plain JavaScript object. Props holds information that influences the output of render and then passed into the component, which is similar to how an argument is passed to a function. 

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components. Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of side effects. Whether or not you’re used to calling these operations “side effects” (or just “effects”), where we’ve performed them in our components projects. The majority of effects don’t need to happen synchronously. In the uncommon cases where they do (such as measuring the layout), there is a separate useLayoutEffect Hook with an API identical to useEffect. useEffect lets us express different kinds of side effects after a component renders.
